# Database Migration Plan: On-premises SQL Server to Cloud (Azure SQL / AWS RDS)

## 1. Pre-Migration Planning
### 1.1 Assess Current Infrastructure
- Review the on-premises SQL Server version and hardware specs.
- Identify the database size, tables, and objects that need to be migrated.
- Verify whether the existing on-prem SQL Server can be directly migrated to Azure SQL or AWS RDS.

### 1.2 Choose the Cloud Service
- **Azure SQL Database**: Choose if you want a fully managed SQL database.
- **AWS RDS (SQL Server)**: Choose if you want to use AWS's managed relational database service.

### 1.3 Review Network and Security Requirements
- Ensure VPN or ExpressRoute for secure communication between on-premises and cloud environments.
- Set up proper firewall rules and security group configurations.

### 1.4 Backup Strategy
- Perform a full backup of the database before starting the migration.
- Create transaction log backups to minimize data loss during migration.

## 2. Migration Strategy
### 2.1 Option 1: Use Backup and Restore Method
1. **Take a Backup**:
   - Perform a full backup of the on-prem database.
   - Ensure the backup is compatible with the cloud database (Azure SQL or AWS RDS).

2. **Restore the Backup to the Cloud**:
   - **For Azure SQL**: Use the `Azure Storage Blob` and `Azure Import/Export` service.
   - **For AWS RDS**: Use the `AWS RDS DB Snapshot` feature to restore the backup.

3. **Verify Data Integrity**:
   - After the restore, ensure that all data and objects are correctly migrated.

### 2.2 Option 2: Use Data Migration Tools
- **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**: 
   - Configure DMS to migrate the data and schema.
   - Monitor the migration and resolve any issues during the transfer.
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**:
   - Use AWS DMS to facilitate continuous migration with minimal downtime.
   - Ensure the target database is properly configured in AWS.

### 2.3 Cutover and Final Sync
- Once the initial migration is done, perform a **final sync** of transaction logs to ensure that any new data added after the initial backup is transferred.
- Schedule the cutover time for production to minimize downtime.
- Switch all applications to point to the new cloud database.

## 3. Post-Migration Steps
### 3.1 Verify Application Compatibility
- Ensure all applications are working with the cloud database.
- Test the application to make sure there are no performance issues.

### 3.2 Performance Tuning
- Analyze query performance in the cloud and optimize if necessary.
- Monitor and optimize indexes, queries, and database configurations.

### 3.3 Set Up Backups and Monitoring
- Set up automated backups and monitoring for the cloud database.
- Enable cloud-native tools for continuous performance monitoring and alerts.

## 4. Rollback Plan
- If any issues arise during migration, restore the database from the backup to the original on-prem SQL Server.
- Ensure the rollback can be done within the agreed maintenance window.

## 5. Final Documentation
- Document the migration process, issues encountered, and resolutions.
- Provide a final report to stakeholders and IT teams.

## 6. Conclusion
The database migration to the cloud is complete. Continuous monitoring and performance optimization should be performed regularly to ensure optimal performance in the cloud environment.
