# Server Migration Plan: On-Premises to Cloud (AWS/Azure)

## 1. Pre-Migration Planning
### 1.1 Assess Current Server Configuration
- Review the current server’s specs: CPU, memory, storage, and operating system.
- Identify the applications and services running on the server.
- Ensure that the cloud environment has equivalent or better resources to support the migration.

### 1.2 Choose Cloud Provider
- **AWS EC2** or **Azure VM** based on your organization's preference.
- Choose the correct instance type (CPU, memory, etc.) to match the current server’s performance.

### 1.3 Backup Strategy
- Create a full backup of the server, including databases, configurations, and applications.
- Verify the backup by restoring it to a test environment.

### 1.4 Network and Security Review
- Ensure secure network connectivity between the on-premises server and the cloud (VPN or Direct Connect).
- Review firewall and security group configurations.

## 2. Migration Strategy
### 2.1 Option 1: Manual Migration
1. **Create a Virtual Machine** on AWS EC2 or Azure VM.
2. **Install necessary software** (Operating System, applications, etc.).
3. **Restore the backup** on the new server.
4. **Test the application and services** to ensure they are running as expected.

### 2.2 Option 2: Automated Migration Using AWS/Azure Tools
- **AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)**:
  - Use AWS SMS to automate the replication of on-premises servers to AWS.
  - Launch the new EC2 instance once the server is replicated.
- **Azure Migrate**:
  - Use Azure Migrate to discover and replicate the on-premises server to Azure.
  - Validate the migration and ensure applications run correctly.

## 3. Post-Migration Steps
### 3.1 Verify Server Performance
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk utilization in the cloud environment to ensure the server performs as expected.
- Adjust the instance size if necessary.

### 3.2 Test Applications and Services
- Ensure all applications and services are working as expected.
- Check connectivity, authentication, and server roles.

### 3.3 Final Cleanup
- Remove any old server images and data backups after confirming the migration is successful.
- Update DNS records and networking configurations to point to the new server.

## 4. Rollback Plan
- If issues arise, revert to the backup and restore the server to its original environment.
- Ensure rollback is possible within the planned maintenance window.

## 5. Final Documentation
- Document the migration steps, configuration changes, and issues encountered.
- Share the final migration report with the team and stakeholders.

## 6. Conclusion
The server migration is complete. Monitor server performance regularly, and implement any required adjustments based on usage patterns.
