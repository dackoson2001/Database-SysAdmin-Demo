# Stakeholder Report: Database and Server Migration Project

## 1. Project Overview
The project aims to migrate our internal databases and servers from an on-premises environment to a cloud-based solution (Azure SQL / AWS RDS and EC2 / Azure VMs). This transition will enhance performance, scalability, and reduce operational costs.

## 2. Current Status
### 2.1 Database Migration
- **Completed**: Assessment of current database structure and selection of migration method.
- **In Progress**: Data migration to the cloud using Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
- **Next Steps**: Final sync of data and cutover to the cloud database.

### 2.2 Server Migration
- **Completed**: Initial server assessment and backup completed.
- **In Progress**: Setting up cloud-based virtual machines (AWS EC2 / Azure VMs) and restoring server images.
- **Next Steps**: Test application compatibility and ensure all services are running smoothly.

## 3. Risks and Challenges
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that no data is lost during migration. We are taking regular backups and conducting tests.
- **Downtime**: Minimizing downtime during the cutover phase. The migration is scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.

## 4. Timeline
- **Database Migration**: Expected completion in the next 2 days.
- **Server Migration**: Expected completion in the next 3 days.
- **Post-Migration Testing**: Ongoing, with final validation in 5 days.

## 5. Action Items
- **Database Team**: Complete the final data migration and sync.
- **Server Team**: Finalize server migration and perform compatibility testing.
- **Consulting Team**: Prepare final project report and documentation for stakeholders.

## 6. Conclusion
The migration project is progressing as planned. We are addressing all challenges and ensuring minimal disruption. The project is on track to meet its goals and deadlines.
